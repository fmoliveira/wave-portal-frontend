# Wave Portal Frontend

> Disclaimer: project implemented in a half-day hackathon, I will soon revisit it to improve so many things
> (I still plan to revisit it, so much love for this lil' app!)

> Limitation: you need to have Metamask installed and be connected to the Rinkeby testnet to interact with this app. I will soon make the read-only mode available globally without this limitation!

Send me a hello through the blockchain!
